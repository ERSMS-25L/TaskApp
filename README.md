# ERSMS 25L - Task Management Application

## Overview

The Task Management Application is a microservices-based application designed to provide a seamless experience for managing personal tasks. It includes three primary services: User Service, Task Service and Notification Service, along with a Frontend that allows users to interact with the backend services. This application is developed and deployed using Docker and Kubernetes, with Google Cloud Platform (GCP) as the cloud provider.

## Architecture

This application follows a 3-tier architecture:

1. **Frontend**: A React-based UI that interacts with backend services.
2. **Backend Services**:
   - **User Service**: Manages user authentication and profiles.
   - **Task Service**: Handles CRUD operations for tasks.
   - **Notification Service**: Sends notifications (e.g., email, SMS) for task deadline reminders and alerts.
   - **Donation Service**: Provides Stripe-based donation functionality.
3. **Database**: SQLite is used for data persistence in this example.
4. **Authentication**: Firebase Authentication handles login/logout.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React
- **Backend**: FastAPI
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes
- **Cloud Provider**: Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for automated Docker builds and Kubernetes deployments
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform for creating GKE clusters and managing resources
- **Secrets Management**: Google Secrets Manager for secure configuration management

## CI/CD Pipeline

- **CI**: GitHub Actions automates Docker image building and pushes to Google Container Registry (GCR). It includes linting and testing workflows.
- **CD**: GitHub Actions deploys the services to Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE).
- **Infrastructure**: Terraform is used to create and manage GKE clusters and other necessary resources.

### GitHub Secrets
Store your Google Cloud service account JSON key in the repository settings as `GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY` and your base64-encoded kubeconfig as `KUBECONFIG_FILE`. These secrets are used by GitHub Actions to build images and deploy to the cluster.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/)
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) (for monitoring setup)
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ERSMS-25L/TaskApp.git
   cd TaskApp
   ```

2. **Build and deploy Docker images** for each service:

   ```bash
   cd user-service
   docker build -t gcr.io/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/user-service:latest .
   docker push gcr.io/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/user-service:latest

   cd ../task-service
   docker build -t gcr.io/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/task-service:latest .
   docker push gcr.io/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/task-service:latest

   cd ../notification-service
   docker build -t gcr.io/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/notification-service:latest .
   docker push gcr.io/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/notification-service:latest

   cd ../frontend
   docker build -t gcr.io/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/frontend:latest .
   docker push gcr.io/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/frontend:latest
   ```

3. **Deploy the application on Kubernetes**:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f gcp/iac/k8s_manifests/
   ```

### Running Locally with Docker Compose

To run the application locally using Docker Compose, follow these steps:

1. Ensure Docker Compose is installed.
   The repository already contains a `docker-compose.yml` that builds all services locally. It also passes the required environment variables to the React frontend so it can reach the backend services.

2. **Run the application** using Docker Compose:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

Ensure you set the environment variables defined in `env_example` for local runs. These include Firebase credentials for the frontend and Stripe keys for the donation service.
For Kubernetes deployments, most variables are provided by the ConfigMaps and Secrets located under `gcp-iac/k8s_manifests`.

### Firebase Credentials

For Firebase Authentication, create a service account in the Firebase console and download the JSON credentials. When running locally, set `FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS_JSON` to the contents of this JSON file:

```bash
export FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS_JSON="$(cat path/to/service_account.json)"
```

The Docker Compose file passes this variable to the user service so it can initialise Firebase Admin.

3. **Access the application** by navigating to `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.
4. **Test notifications** by sending a request:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8003/send-notification \
        -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        -d '{"message":"Hello","recipient":"test@example.com","notification_type":"email"}'
   ```

### Kubernetes Deployment

Create a secret for the Firebase service account before applying the manifests:

```bash
kubectl create secret generic firebase-sa --from-file=credentials.json=path/to/service_account.json
```

Create a secret containing the Stripe API keys for the donation service:

```bash
kubectl create secret generic donation-service-secrets \
  --from-literal=STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=<your-stripe-secret> \
  --from-literal=STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=<your-publishable-key>
```

Then deploy the manifests in `gcp-iac/k8s_manifests`:

#### Frontend Dashboard

The application's frontend dashboard can be accessed at the LoadBalancer IP for the frontend service. Hereâ€™s a preview of the dashboard:


## Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana

To monitor the application, we use Prometheus and Grafana. These can be easily deployed using Helm.

### Step 1: Install Prometheus and Grafana Using Helm

1. **Add Helm Repositories**:

   ```bash
   helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts
   helm repo add grafana https://grafana.github.io/helm-charts
   helm repo update
   ```

2. **Create a Namespace for Monitoring**:

   ```bash
   kubectl create namespace monitoring
   ```

3. **Install Prometheus**:

   ```bash
   helm install prometheus-stack prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack --namespace monitoring
   ```

4. **Install Grafana**:

   ```bash
   helm install grafana grafana/grafana --namespace monitoring
   ```

### Step 2: Access Grafana Dashboard

1. **Get Grafana Admin Password**:

   ```bash
   kubectl get secret --namespace monitoring grafana -o jsonpath="{.data.admin-password}" | base64 --decode ; echo
   ```

2. **Retrieve External IPs for Prometheus and Grafana**:

   ```bash
   kubectl get svc -n monitoring
   ```

3. **Access Grafana** at `http://<GRAFANA_EXTERNAL_IP>:3000` and log in using the admin password obtained above.

4. **Configure Prometheus as a Data Source** in Grafana:

   - In Grafana, go to **Configuration > Data Sources**.
   - Add a new Prometheus data source with URL `http://prometheus-operated.monitoring.svc.cluster.local:9090`.

### Step 3: Explore Dashboards

Grafana comes with pre-configured dashboards for Kubernetes monitoring. You can start exploring metrics for CPU, memory usage, request rate, and other Kubernetes and application metrics.
